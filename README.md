## Introduction ##

[Markdown] is a simple markup language used to convert plain text into HTML. 

[MultiMarkdown] is a derivative of Markdown that adds new syntax features, such as footnotes, tables, and metadata. Additionally, it offers mechanisms to convert plain text into LaTeX in addition to HTML. 


## Background ##

MultiMarkdown started as a Perl script, which was modified from the original Markdown.pl.

MultiMarkdown v3 (aka 'peg-multimarkdown') was based on John MacFarlane's [peg-markdown].  It used a parsing expression grammar (PEG), and was written in C in order to compile on almost any operating system.  Thanks to work by Daniel Jalkut, MMD v3 was built so that it didn't have any external library requirements.

MultiMarkdown v4 was basically a complete rewrite of v3.  It used the same basic PEG for parsing (Multi)Markdown text, but otherwise was almost completely rebuilt.

MultiMarkdown v5 is basically the same code as v4, but the project has been restructured:

*	It is built using my [c-template] project boilerplate -- I welcome
	suggestions and ideas for improvement about this.
*	It is designed with the CMake build system, rather than just
	a Makefile



## Why switch to CMake? ##

In early 2014, a user of MMD introduced me to the [CMake] build system. I 
looked at it briefly, but didn't do anything with it.  Later on, I looked
at it more in depth and created a parallel branch after 4.6.  This would allow
me to experiment with CMake without breaking anything else in the `master`
branch.

CMake isn't perfect by any means, but it does allow for some interesting
things:

*	Automatically generate GUI installers for OS X and Windows, as well as zip
	files for *nix.  I have not looked into using CMake to build `.deb`
	packages, but that might be possible as well.  My old system could generate
	GUI installers for Windows and OS X, but it was a complex process that
	required a lot of manual processing.  This is much more amenable to
	automation.
*	An improved organization structure for various tests, including [Valgrind]
	testing.  The old system was getting rather messy.
*	A templating system that better allows me to synchronize version, and
	other, information in code, documentation, and READMEs
*	Automatic generation of project files for Xcode, Visual Studio, and
	alternative build systems beyond `make`
*	An opportunity to reorganize my code directory hierarchy
*	The option to start adding unit test code to the source.  This probably
	won't happen, as it would be too much work.  But it is possible.


The biggest *problem* is that this means that anyone wishing to compile the
source will need to install CMake.  This isn't hard, but it is an extra step.

As a temporary measure, you can use the `make deprecated` command to use a 
simplified `make` recipe to compile a binary of MultiMarkdown for the current
machine.  I don't recommend this approach, but it should work in a pinch until
you can upgrade your machine to support cmake.

I welcome feedback on this decision, but please note -- "I don't like it" or
"bring back the old way" comments will be ignored.  Please send meaningful
criticism or suggestions.

Perhaps an approach if others want to contribute will be to do the reverse of
what I did before -- create a `make` branch that includes a modified Makefile
designed to be used without CMake?

Additionally, the old Makefile had grown over time to include some tricks that
users of various systems required.  I have tested the CMake system on OS X,
Ubuntu and Debian Linux, and MinGW on Ubuntu.  I welcome suggestions for
improvements to the CMake configuration.


## Download Binary ##


## Compile from Source ##

To compile MultiMarkdown, you will need to have [CMake] installed on your machine.

To download the source:

*	Obtain the source from the github page:

		git clone https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-5.git

*	Configure the submodules with two helper scripts (This can be done manually on Windows systems by looking at the source):

		./link_git_modules
		./update_git_modules

*	Compile, and (optionally) test:

		make
		cd build
		make
		make test

Like all versions of MultiMarkdown since v3, there is one test that will fail (now helpfully called `markdown-should-fail`).  The other tests should pass.  The valgrind tests will not work on OS X, but should pass if valgrind is installed and used on Linux machines.

If you want to make an installer, after the above, use the `cpack` command inside the build directory.

For more information, checkout the `IMPORTANT` file.


## Usage ##

The [MultiMarkdown User's Guide] has complete instructions on how to use MultiMarkdown.


## Developer's Notes ##

The documentation, created by doxygen, has information for developers:

	make documentation

You can then view `build/documentation/html/index.html` for some developer's notes.  There's not a lot there yet.  There is also a LaTeX version created if you want a PDF.  Just use latexmk in the latex directory.


# LyX Support #

Charles R. Cowan (<https://github.com/crcowan>) added support for conversion to [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/).  Support for this should be considered to be in alpha/beta, and is not guaranteed.  Issues related to LyX can be added to the MultiMarkdown [issues] page on github, but will need to be answered by Charles.  I am happy to include this code in the main MMD repo, but since I don't use LyX I can't support it myself.  If this arrangement becomes a problem, then LyX support can be removed and it can be kept as a separate fork.
