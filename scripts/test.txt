# Introduction #

As I add increasing numbers of features to MultiMarkdown, I decided it was time to create a sample document to show them off. Many of the features are demonstrated in the [MultiMarkdown User's Guide][], but some are not. 

Additionally, it's easy for those features to get lost within all of the technical documentation.  This document is designed to *demonstrate*, not describe, most of the features of MultiMarkdown.
